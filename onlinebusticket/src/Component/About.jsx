            The case study in question is part of the online travel industry in India. RedBus is an online bus ticketing company that uses a real time and web-based portal that connects bus operators with potential customers. As a company, RedBus has an organizational structure in place under the leadership of three partners.



The previous manual bus ticketing system inconvenienced customers who considered it tedious. The bus operators also faced transparency issues with ticket dealers who were tasked with selling bus tickets. RedBus has introduced a web-based technology that allows customers to book tickets online and for bus operators to sell their tickets using the RedBus system.

<br></br>

The key issues are the need to provide efficient bus ticketing services to bus operators as well as the provision of convenience to customers in need of bus ticketing services.

The decision makers are the partners, Phanindra Sama, Charan Padmaraju and Sudhakar Pasupunuri.

The assumptions are based on socio-economic, political and technological trends. In this case, it is projected that a global bus manufacturing unit will be established in India. In addition, the country will experience a mass migration of skilled labor to cities, as well as register an increase in mobile and technology penetration. As a result, the demand for bus ticketing services is likely, thereby translating to increased business for RedBus.
